[Bosch BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bme680)
temperature/humidity/VOC/barometric pressure sensor service plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).


* Display of temperature, humidity and air quality score from a BME680 connected to a RaspberryPI.

Uses [bme680-sensor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bme680-sensor)

Uses the algorithm used by pimoroni in their [bme680-sensor-air-quality-example](https://github.com/pimoroni/bme680-python/blob/master/examples/indoor-air-quality.py) to compute the air quality score

## Installation
1.	Install Homebridge using `npm install -g homebridge`
2.	Install this plugin `npm install -g homebridge-bme680`
3.	Update your configuration file - see below for an example

Connect the BME680 chip to the I2C bus

Enable I2C on the RaspberryPI by going to the RaspberryPI's `RaspberryPi Configuration` page and checking the `Enable I2C` checkbox.

## Configuration
* `accessory`: "BME680"
* `name`: descriptive name
* `name_temperature` (optional): descriptive name for the temperature sensor
* `name_humidity` (optional): descriptive name for the humidity sensor
* `name_air_quality` (optional): descriptive name for the air quality sensor
* `refresh`: Optional, time interval for refreshing data in seconds, defaults to 60 seconds.
* `options`: options for [bme680-sensor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bme680-sensor)

If you get an I/O error, make sure the I2C address is correct (usually 0x76 or 0x77 depending on a jumper).

Example configuration:

```json
    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "BME680",
            "name": "Sensor",
            "name_temperature": "Temperature",
            "name_humidity": "Humidity",
            "options": {
              "i2cBusNo": 1,
              "i2cAddress": "0x76"
            }
        }
    ]
```

This plugin creates two services: TemperatureSensor and HumiditySensor.

## Future plans
- Add support for pressure sensor (this is already somewhat supported, but you can't see it in the Home app). Will try to get the Home+ 5 app which supposedly Pressure sensor displays
